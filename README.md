Calculate the   1-day 99%   VaR   on   March   10, 2006 and   December   15,   2008, for a $10   million   portfolio   invested   in the   NASDAQ composite   index   using   the   methods   indicated   below. 
a)          (10) The   basic   historical simulation approach,
b)         (10) The exponential weighting scheme with λ =   0.94,
c)             (10)   Extreme value theory   with   u   =   0.03,
2.    Using the data describing   a   universe   of   risky   asset代 写Market investmentC/C++
代做程序编程语言s   (found   in   the   attached   spreadsheet   - Sheet   2), and where there   is a   risk-free   rate of 4.5%,   find   the   optimal   (tangent)   PF   of   risky   assets   in three cases. Assume the variance of the   market   portfolio   is   10.
